Proving Information Inequalities by Gaussian Elimination

Abstract
-----
Proving information inequalities and identities under linear constraints on the information measures is an important problem in information theory. For this purpose, ITIP and other variant algorithms have been developed and implemented, which are all based on solving a linear program (LP). We have recently developed a symbolic computation approach that can solve such LPs very efficiently. In some cases, only the Gaussian elimination is needed without having to solve an LP. In other cases, the original LP is reduced to a much smaller LP.

Information Theory Inspired Deep Learning

Abstract
-----
As deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) pushes our information age to a new high, is it possible for information theory (IT) to jump on the bandwagon? In this talk, we will provide an affirmative answer to this question by introducing IT concepts and optimization techniques into deep learning (DL) and presenting several IT inspired deep learning paradigms. It is shown that (1) conditional mutual information (CMI) can be used to measure the concentration of a classification deep neural network (DNN) in the output probability distribution space of the DNN, and (2) optimization techniques in rate distortion function and channel capacity can be modified to minimize (maximize, resp.) CMI along with minimizing the standard cross entropy function in DL, yielding CMI constrained deep learning (CMIC-DL), knowledge distillation (KD) resistant DL, and KD-amplifying DL. Extensive experiment results show that DNNs trained within these IT inspired DL paradigms outperform the state-of-the-art models trained within the standard DL and other loss functions in the literature.

One-shot Coding using Poisson Processes

Abstract
-----
Finite blocklength analysis is applicable to practical communication scenarios where the message length does not approach infinity. We present an approach to proving finite blocklength coding theorems via the Poisson functional representation, which can be regarded as a mechanism capable of answering queries. Encoding and decoding operations can be performed using queries, and the error probability can be bounded via the Poisson matching lemma. This approach provides tight one-shot and finite blocklength results in various multiuser communication settings, with proofs even shorter than conventional asymptotic techniques in certain settings. This talk is based on a joint work with Venkat Anantharam (UC Berkeley): C. T. Li and V. Anantharam, "A Unified Framework for One-Shot Achievability via the Poisson Matching Lemma," IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 67, no. 5, pp. 2624-2651, 2021.

Information-Directed Sampling: An Information-Theoretic Method for Reinforcement Learning

Abstract
-----
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial and rapidly developing field in modern AI, with applications spanning various real-world scenarios such as LLMs, games, and robotics. A central challenge in RL is to address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is not only an elegant theoretical problem but also a key factor affecting its practicality and efficiency. This talk will introduce an information-theory-inspired method, called information-directed sampling (IDS), that effectively addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In this method, we use mutual information to measure the amount of information that can be learned about the environment, and leverage rate-distortion theory to compress the environment to reduce complexity. IDS then seeks a balance between the amount of learned information (exploration) and the immediate reward (exploitation). Theoretically, IDS is nearly order-optimal in terms of data efficiency in RL and related problems like multi-armed bandits and multi-agent RL, in the sense that its regret approaches information-theoretic lower bounds. This practice not only advances the development of efficient algorithms for RL, but also showcases how information-theoretical insights can drive practical advancements in modern AI.

Optimal Finite-length Linear Codes for Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels with Feedback

Abstract
-----
With the recent emergence of many low-latency applications over wireless networks, the need for accurate finite-length analysis of channel coding over multi-user wireless channels is ever increasing. This talk focuses exclusively on the two-user broadcast packet erasure channel (PEC) with causal feedback, for which existing results show that various linear network coding (LNC) schemes can attain the broadcast capacity region when the block length approaches infinity. Complementing the well known asymptotic capacity based analysis, this work derives the exact value of the optimal second-order achievabilty among all possible LNCs which closes the gap between the state-of-the-art LNC second-order inner and outer bounds. A byproduct of the results is to show that among many existing asymptotically capacity-achieving LNC schemes, one (class) of them is provably finite-length optimal and should be the default design choice for any two-user broadcast PECs. Extensions to vector LNCs as well as their connections to finite-length non-linear codes will also be explored.

Fundamental Limits of Large-Scale MIMO Systems: A Random Matrix Theory Perspective

Abstract
-----
Wireless communications have evolved through several generations and the basic trend is to explore more spectrum (from sub-6G to mmWave and THz) and improve the spectral efficiency (denser cells and larger antenna arrays, e.g., massive/extra-large/holographic MIMO). To fully exploit the potential of large-scale MIMO systems, we need to accurately characterize their fundamental limits. However, the high dimensionality makes performance evaluation and system design very challenging. Fortunately, many information-theoretic problems for MIMO systems resort to the spectral analysis of channel matrices, which can be tackled by asymptotic random matrix theory (RMT). Notably, the mutual information (MI) of MIMO fading channels is a special case of linear spectral statistics where the ergodic MI and outage probability can be approximated by the central limit theorem (CLT) for the random channel matrix. In this talk, we will introduce the CLT for random matrices and its applications in large-scale MIMO systems. Specifically, we will share our results regarding the fundamental limits of several large-scale MIMO channels, including the non-Gaussian fading channels, the two-hop channels, and the two-hop wiretap channels. Furthermore, we will show how asymptotic RMT can facilitate the finite block-length (FBL) analysis of large-scale MIMO systems. The RMT framework introduced for the performance analysis and system design of large-scale MIMO systems can be applied to other high-dimensional problems such as chaotic physics, signal processing, and theoretical machine learning.

Towards Explainable AI that Promotes AI-human Mutual Understanding

Abstract
-----
Recent advances in deep learning-based AI has necessitated better explanations on AI’s operations to enhance transparency of AI’s decisions, especially in critical systems such as self-driving car or medical diagnosis applications, to ensure safety, user trust and user satisfaction. However, current Explainable AI (XAI) solutions focus on using more AI to explain AI, without considering users’ mental processes. Here we use cognitive science theories and methodologies to develop a next-generation XAI framework that promotes human-AI mutual understanding, using computer vision AI models as examples due to its importance in critical systems. Specifically, we propose to equip XAI with an important cognitive capacity in human social interaction: theory of mind (ToM), i.e., the capacity to understand others’ behaviour by attributing mental states to them. We focus on two ToM abilities: (1) Inferring human strategy and performance (i.e., Machine’s ToM), and (2) Inferring human understanding of AI strategy and trust towards AI (i.e., to infer Human’s ToM). Computational modeling of human cognition and experimental psychology methods play an important role for XAI to develop these two ToM abilities to provide user-centered explanations through comparing users’ strategy with AI’s strategy and estimating user’s current understanding of AI’s strategy, similar to real-life teachers. Enhanced human-AI mutual understanding can in turn lead to better adoption and trust of AI systems. This framework thus highlights the importance of cognitive science approaches to XAI.

Diminishing Exploration: A Minimalist Approach to Piecewise Stationary Multi-Armed Bandits

Abstract
-----
The piecewise-stationary bandit problem is an important variant of the multi-armed bandit problem that further considers abrupt changes in the reward distributions. The main theme of the problem is the trade-off between exploration for detecting environment changes and exploitation of traditional bandit algorithms. While this problem has been extensively investigated, existing works either assume knowledge about the number of change points $M$ or require extremely high computational complexity. In this work, we revisit the piecewise-stationary bandit problem from a minimalist perspective. We propose a novel and generic exploration mechanism, called diminishing exploration, which eliminates the need for knowledge about $M$ and can be used in conjunction with an existing change detection-based algorithm to achieve near-optimal regret scaling. Simulation results show that despite oblivious of $M$, equipping existing algorithms with the proposed diminishing exploration generally achieves better empirical regret than existing approaches.

Exploring Strengths and Weaknesses of Transformers Through the Lens of Information Theory 

Abstract
-----
With the advent of ChatGPT, Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are receiving widespread attention from both academia and industry. OpenAI's scaling law predicts that training larger models with more data can lead to better performance. Based on this, the parameter scale of recent large models can reach the level of hundreds of billions and are trained on text data at the scale of hundreds of billions. However, increasing the size of the Transformer model does not always lead to performance improvement—a phenomenon that cannot be explained by the empirical scaling law. In addition, when the model memorizes training samples, its generalization ability is enhanced. This report will briefly introduce our preliminary exploration in the theoretical modeling of Transformer models. We simulate the behavior of Transformers using Hopfield networks, linking them to associative memory, allowing each Transformer block to perform approximate nearest neighbor searches. Based on this, we propose a new energy function that reveals a dependency between model size and datasets under certain conditions. We also discuss our recent work on extending the context window of LLMs through the lens of information theory.
